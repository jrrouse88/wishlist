# ComicColl

---

A place for comic nerds to store their library.

Visit the app [ComicColl](https://secret-chamber-72331.herokuapp.com/)

Take a look at my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/F6ydCQPL/project-2)

## How It Works

Sign Up to create and account. Once your account is created you can add comics to your library by visiting your page. If you have the cover image of the comic, feel free to add a URL linking to it.

Each comic can be edited after it has been added to your library. If you ever decide you're too old for comics, you can delete your account and continue your mundane comic free life.
